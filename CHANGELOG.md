# 10.0.0 (2020-09-15)

### Highlights

#### Open source

The UI component library (now called `ng-aquila`) is now open source ðŸŽ‰. That brings some changes for internal projects but with the power of schematics all the necessary changes are automatically migrated.

#### Right-to-left support
We are introducing Right-to-left (RTL) Support into the library. We are confident that most components work pretty good but we greatly appreciate any feedback from right-to-left users.
You can change direction by adding `dir="rtl"` to your HTML Element.
