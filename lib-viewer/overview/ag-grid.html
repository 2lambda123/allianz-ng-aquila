<div class="docs-deprecation-warning">
    <strong>Beta/Experimental version: </strong> please note that this is a first version for teams to jump  in early and provide feedback.
    There might be features of ag-grid that do not work well with the theme yet. We are happy to hear your feedback.
</div>
<p class="docs-markdown--p">For complex data tables (data grids) we suggest using the <a href="https://www.ag-grid.com/">ag-grid</a> library. We are providing an <code>ag-theme-aquila</code> theme for the ag-grid-angular component which is based on the ag-theme-alpine theme and is a drop-in replacement for the default ag-grid themes. You can also choose from additional modifier themes on top of the base theme:</p>
<ul class="docs-markdown--ul">
<li class="docs-markdown--li"><code>ag-theme-aquila-dense</code> for more compact rows</li>
<li class="docs-markdown--li"><code>ag-theme-aquila-zebra</code> for zebra striped rows</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="compatibility" tabindex="-1" class="docs-markdown--h2">Compatibility</h2>
<p class="docs-markdown--p">The theme was built with ag-grid-angular version <code>^30.0.0</code>. It might work with other versions as well, but we did not test it.</p>
<p class="docs-markdown--p">Please also note that for some design features the theme makes use of the <code>:has</code> css selector which is currently still in development in Firefox, as such we are not supporting Firefox at the moment.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use" tabindex="-1" class="docs-markdown--h2">How to use</h2>
<p class="docs-markdown--p">The ag-grid theme assumes that one of the library themes is already imported to use css variables from there.</p>
<ul class="docs-markdown--ul">
<li class="docs-markdown--li">Import the provided file from <code>@aposin/ng-aquila/css/themes/ag-theme-aquila.css</code> and add it to your application. You can choose any of the typical ways in an angular application, e.g. in the angular.json file or in your main styles.(s)css file.</li>
<li class="docs-markdown--li">Add the class <code>ag-theme-aquila</code> to the ag-grid-angular element.</li>
<li class="docs-markdown--li"><strong>Optional:</strong> add one of the modifier classes <code>ag-theme-aquila-dense</code> or <code>ag-theme-aquila-zebra</code> to the ag-grid-angular element as well. You can also combine them and add or remove them dynamically.</li>
<li class="docs-markdown--li"><strong>Allianz internal projects</strong>: add the class <code>ag-allianz-icons</code> to the ag-grid-angular element to overwrite the default ag-grid alpine icons with the Allianz icons.</li>
</ul>
