<p class="docs-markdown--p">The toolbar is a visual container for elements (e.g. icons, buttons, icon tooltips). It is recommended to keep the total number of icons as short as possible as well as to avoid combining a back button with breadcrumbs. The toolbar should only contain CTA elements that influence the content area. It is not used for information or global navigation (e.g progress bar).</p>

<h3 id="positioning-toolbar-content" class="docs-markdown--h3">Positioning toolbar content</h3>
<p class="docs-markdown--p">The toolbar component is a container for its content without any positioning. So you have the freedom to position the content depending on the use case.</p>
<p class="docs-markdown--p">The toolbar uses a flexbox row layout. This makes positioning the elements easy using flex.</p>
