<p class="docs-markdown--p">This component provides a basic skeleton of the footer including two parts. On one hand there is the <code>nx-footer-copyright</code> section, which applies a basic styling to this block. On the other hand there is the <code>nx-footer-navigation</code> directive in order to give this element the <code>list</code> role. In there, you have the option to place all your footer links. They have to be placed inside of the <code>nx-footer-link</code> selector in order to get the <code>listitem</code> role and the corresponding styling and behaviour.</p>
