Use this component to present a card with different options.

### Default

<!-- example(card) -->

### Highlight card

With `highlight` you can allow a highlight header to be shown on the card.

<!-- example(highlight-card) -->

### Selectable Card

#### Checkbox behavior

<!-- example(selectable-card-basic) -->

#### Radio button behavior

in case you want selectable cards with radio selection,
you can use `nx-selectable-card-group` to group the cards, and they will automatically function as radio buttons.

<!-- example(selectable-card-radio) -->

#### Product Card

<!-- example(selectable-card-product) -->

#### Selectable Card States

<!-- example(selectable-card-states) -->

#### Highlight selectable card

With `highlight` you can allow a highlight header to be shown on the card.

<!-- example(highlight-selectable-card) -->

#### Reactive Forms

<!-- example(selectable-card-reactive) -->

#### Dynamically adding and removing cards

<!-- example(selectable-card-dynamic) -->

<div class="docs-expert-container">

### Expert: Appearance

With `appearance` you can change the styling of the card to expert. Using the `NxExpertModule` will automatically set that option and you don't have to set it in the template manually.
Works for both checkbox and radio style cards.
