# Intro

Buttons are used to make common actions immediately visible and easy to perform. This component allows users to trigger an action â€“ either by clicking on or tapping the button, or by pressing certain keyboard keys (such as Enter or the space bar). Depending on the use case, buttons contain a label and/or an icon. There are multiple styles, sizes, and variations that can be used for different situations. We attach buttons through a directive so that we can rely on the native abilities of a real **`<button>`** tag.

We work with five different types of buttons. The primary's heavy appearance is intended to direct the user to take a suggested primary action; the secondary's lighter design best works to compliment a primary action or to reduce visual noise if there are several hierarchically equal actions on the same page. Emphasis, call-to-action and disabled should be self-explanatory.
