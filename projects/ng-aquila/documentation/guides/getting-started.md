# Getting started
With ng-aquila we are providing an Angular powered user interface (UI) library.

### Prerequisite
You should have Node.js and the Angular CLI installed.

### Setup

1. Create your project with Angular CLI:
    ```console
    ng new my-aposin-project
    ```

2. Install ng-aquila:
    ```console
    ng add @aposin/ng-aquila
    ```

Congratulations you're done ðŸ’ª 

Now you can include components and start building your application.

### Device and Browser Support
We fully support the following browsers:

* Latest versions of Firefox, Chrome, and Safari
* MS Edge
* High contrast mode in MS IE11 and Edge

We partly support IE11 and recommend to use modern browsers instead. Using IE11 can have a negative impact on UX and performance. 

### Contributing
We do not support external contributions yet, but hope we can in future.
